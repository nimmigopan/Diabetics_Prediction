- Pregnancies: The number of pregnancies the individual has had.

- Age: The age of the individual.
- Outcome: This is the target variable. It indicates whether the individual has diabetes (1) or does not have diabetes (0).

Using this data a machine learning model is built to predict diabetes based on the provided attributes.
SVM is uesd to train the data and by using streamlit a interactive web application is created.
